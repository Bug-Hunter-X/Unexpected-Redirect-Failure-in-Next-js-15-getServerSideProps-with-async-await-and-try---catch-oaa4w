# Unexpected Redirect Failure in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered in Next.js 15 applications when using `async/await` within `getServerSideProps` for redirection within a `try...catch` block.  The redirect may fail silently under specific conditions.

## Problem
The provided `bug.js` file illustrates a scenario where data fetching and subsequent redirection using `redirect` within a `try...catch` block doesn't always function as expected.  The redirect fails to execute in certain cases, resulting in unexpected behavior. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  This revised code addresses the issue by ensuring the redirect happens correctly regardless of whether an error is caught within the `try...catch` block. The fix involved restructuring the `try...catch` handling and ensuring the redirection takes place consistently.
